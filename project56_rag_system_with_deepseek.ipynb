It is the main component of nervous tissue. Neurons are typically classified\\ninto three types based on their function. Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch, sound, or light\\nthat affect the cells of the sensory organs, and they send signals to the spinal cord or brain. Motor neurons\\nreceive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular\\noutput. Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord.\\nA group of connected neurons is called a neural circuit.\\nA typical neuron consists of a cell body (soma), dendrites, and a single axon. The soma is usually compact.\\nThe axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it. Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend\\na few hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock,\\nand travels for as far as 1 meter in humans or more in other species. It branches but usually maintains a\\nconstant diameter. At the farthest tip of the axon's branches are axon terminals, where the neuron can\\ntransmit a signal across the synapse to another cell. Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axon. The term\\nneurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly when the cell is undifferentiated.\\nThe soma is the body of the neuron. As it contains the nucleus, most protein synthesis occurs here. The\\nnucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter.\\nThe dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches. This overall shape and structure is\\nreferred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree. This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via\\nthe dendritic spine.\\nThe axon is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of times\\nthe diameter of the soma in length. The axon primarily carries nerve signals away from the soma, and\\ncarries some types of information back to it. Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and\\nusually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the\\naxon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock. Besides being an anatomical structure, the\\naxon hillock also has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most\\neasily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon. In electrophysiological terms, it\\nhas the most negative threshold potential.\\nWhile the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive\\ninput from other neurons.\\nThe axon terminal is found at the end of the axon farthest from the soma and contains synapses. Synaptic\\nboutons are specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals are released to communicate with\\ntarget neurons. In addition to synaptic boutons at the axon terminal, a neuron may have en passant\\nboutons, which are located along the length of the axon.\\nMost neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon. At the\\nmajority of synapses, signals cross from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. However,\\nsynapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite. The signaling process is\\npartly electrical and partly chemical. Neurons are electrically excitable, due to maintenance of voltage\\ngradients across their membranes. If the voltage changes by a large amount over a short interval, the\\nneuron generates an all-or-nothing electrochemical pulse called an action potential. This potential travels\\n\"),\n",

Artificial neurons are elementary units in an artificial neural network. The artificial neuron\\nreceives one or more inputs (representing excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic\\npotentials at neural dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (or activation, representing a neuron's\\naction potential which is transmitted along its axon). Usually each input is separately weighted, and the\\nsum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function. The\\ntransfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear\\nfunctions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often monotonically increasing,\\ncontinuous, differentiable and bounded.

Size: Our brain contains about 86 billion neurons and more than a 100 synapses (connections). The\\nnumber of “neurons” in artificial networks is much less than that.\\n2. Signal transport and processing: The human brain works asynchronously, ANNs work synchronously.\\n3. Processing speed: Single biological neurons are slow, while standard neurons in ANNs are fast.\\n4. Topology: Biological neural networks have complicated topologies, while ANNs are often in a tree\\nstructure.\\n5. Speed: certain biological neurons can fire around 200 times a second on average. Signals travel at\\ndifferent speeds depending on the type of the nerve impulse, ranging from 0.61 m/s up to 119 m/s. Signal\\ntravel speeds also vary from person to person depending on their sex, age, height, temperature, medical\\ncondition, lack of sleep etc. Information in artificial neurons is carried over by the continuous, floating point\\nnumber values of synaptic weights. There are no refractory periods for artificial neural networks (periods\\nwhile it is impossible to send another action potential, due to the sodium channels being lock shut) and\\nartificial neurons do not experience “fatigue”: they are functions that can be calculated as many times and\\nas fast as the computer architecture would allow.\\n6. Fault-tolerance: biological neuron networks due to their topology are also fault-tolerant. Artificial\\nneural networks are not modeled for fault tolerance or self regeneration (similarly to fatigue, these ideas\\nare not applicable to matrix operations), though recovery is possible by saving the current state (weight\\nvalues) of the model and continuing the training from that save state.\\n7. Power consumption: the brain consumes about 20% of all the human body’s energy — despite it’s large\\ncut, an adult brain operates on about 20 watts (barely enough to dimly light a bulb) being extremely\\nefficient. Taking into account how humans can still operate for a while, when only given some c-vitamin\\nrich lemon juice and beef tallow, this is quite remarkable. For benchmark: a single Nvidia GeForce Titan X\\nGPU runs on 250 watts alone, and requires a power supply. Our machines are way less efficient than\\nbiological systems. Computers also generate a lot of heat when used, with consumer GPUs operating safely\\nbetween 50–80°Celsius instead of 36.5–37.5 °C.\\n8. Learning: we still do not understand how brains learn, or how redundant connections store and recall\\ninformation. By learning, we are building on information that is already stored in the brain. Our knowledge\\ndeepens by repetition and during sleep, and tasks that once required a focus can be executed automatically\\nonce mastered. Artificial neural networks in the other hand, have a predefined model, where no further\\nneurons or connections can be added or removed. Only the weights of the connections (and biases\\nrepresenting thresholds) can change during training. The networks start with random weight values and\\nwill slowly try to reach a point where further changes in the weights would no longer improve\\nperformance. Biological networks usually don't stop / start learning. ANNs have different fitting (train) and\\nprediction (evaluate) phases.\\n9. Field of application: ANNs are specialized. They can perform one task. They might be perfect at playing\\nchess, but they fail at playing go (or vice versa). Biological neural networks can learn completely new tasks.\\n10. Training algorithm: ANNs use Gradient Descent for learning. Human brains use something different\\n(but we don't know what).\\n\"),\n",

The connection has\\ndifferent weights upon them. There is no feedback loop means the signal can only flow in one\\ndirection, from input to output.

In other words, we can say the input layer is fully connected to the output\\nlayer.\\n\\uf0b7 Multilayer feed forward network: The concept is of feed forward ANN having more than\\none weighted layer.

Feedback Network: As the name suggests, a feedback network has feedback paths, which means the\\nsignal can flow in both directions using loops.

This learning process is dependent. During the training of ANN under supervised learning, the\\ninput vector is presented to the network, which will give an output vector. This output vector is compared\\nwith the desired output vector. An error signal is generated, if there is a difference between the actual\\noutput and the desired output vector. On the basis of this error signal, the weights are adjusted until the\\nactual output is matched with the desired output.\\nUnsupervised Learning: As the name suggests, this type of learning is done without the supervision of a\\nteacher. This learning process is independent. During the training of ANN under unsupervised learning, the\\ninput vectors of similar type are combined to form clusters. When a new input pattern is applied, then the\\nneural network gives an output response indicating the class to which the input pattern belongs. There is\\nno feedback from the environment as to what should be the desired output and if it is correct or incorrect.\\nHence, in this type of learning, the network itself must discover the patterns and features from the input\\ndata, and the relation for the input data over the output.\\nReinforcement Learning: As the name suggests, this type of learning is used to reinforce or strengthen the\\nnetwork over some critic information. This learning process is similar to supervised learning, however we\\nmight have very less information. During the training of network under reinforcement learning, the\\nnetwork receives some feedback from the environment. This makes it somewhat similar to supervised\\nlearning. However, the feedback obtained here is evaluative not instructive, which means there is no\\nteacher as in supervised learning. After receiving the feedback, the network performs adjustments of the\\nweights to get better critic information in future.\\n3. Activation Functions: An activation function is a mathematical equation that determines the output of\\neach element (perceptron or neuron) in the neural network. It takes in the input from each neuron and\\ntransforms it into an output, usually between one and zero or between -1 and one. It may be defined as\\nthe extra force or effort applied over the input to obtain an exact output. In ANN, we can also apply\\nactivation functions over the input to get the exact output.

Each\\nneuron has a weight, and the inputs are multiplied by the weight and fed into the activation\\nfunction. Each neuron’s output is the input of the neurons in the next layer of the network, and so the\\ninputs cascade through multiple activation functions until eventually, the output layer generates a\\nprediction.

Inputs to a neural network are typically a set of real values; each value is fed into one of the\\nneurons in the input layer.\\nTraining Set: A set of inputs for which the correct outputs are known, used to train the neural network.\\nOutputs : Neural networks generate their predictions in the form of a set of real values or boolean\\ndecisions. Each output value is generated by one of the neurons in the output layer.\\nNeuron/perceptron: The basic unit of the neural network. Accepts an input and generates a prediction.\\nEach neuron accepts part of the input and passes it through the activation function. Common activation\\nfunctions are sigmoid, TanH and ReLu. Activation functions help generate output values within an\\nacceptable range, and their non-linear form is crucial for training the network.\\nWeight Space: Each neuron is given a numeric weight. The weights, together with the activation\\nfunction, define each neuron’s output. Neural networks are trained by fine-tuning weights, to discover\\nthe optimal set of weights that generates the most accurate prediction.\\nForward Pass: The forward pass takes the inputs, passes them through the network and allows each\\nneuron to react to a fraction of the input. Neurons generate their outputs and pass them on to the next\\nlayer, until eventually the network generates an output.\\nError Function: Defines how far the actual output of the current model is from the correct output.

This is\\ncalled backpropagation. Backpropagation tracks the derivatives of the activation functions in each\\nsuccessive neuron, to find weights that bring the loss function to a minimum, which will generate the\\nbest prediction. This is a mathematical process called gradient descent.\\nBias and Variance: When training neural networks, like in other machine learning techniques, we try to\\nbalance between bias and variance. Bias measures how well the model fits the training set—able to\\ncorrectly predict the known outputs of the training examples. Variance measures how well the model\\nworks with unknown inputs that were not available during training. Another meaning of bias is a “ bias\\nneuron” which is used in every layer of the neural network. The bias neuron holds the number 1, and\\nmakes it possible to move the activation function up, down, left and right on the number graph.\\nHyperparameters: A hyper parameter is a setting that affects the structure or operation of the neural\\nnetwork. In real deep learning projects, tuning hyper parameters is the primary way to build a network\\nthat provides accurate predictions for a certain problem. Common hyper parameters include the number\\nof hidden layers, the activation function, and how many times (epochs) training should be repeated.\\nMCCULLOGH-PITTS MODEL\\nIn 1943 two electrical engineers, Warren McCullogh and Walter Pitts, published the first paper describing\\nwhat we would call a neural network.\\nIt may be divided into 2 parts. The first part, g takes an input, performs an aggregation and based on the\\naggregated value the second part, f makes a decision. Let us suppose that I want to predict my own\\ndecision, whether to watch a random football game or not on TV. The inputs are all boolean i.e., {0,1} and\\nmy output variable is also boolean {0: Will watch it, 1: Won’t watch it}.\\nSo, x 1 could be ‘is Indian Premier League On’ (I like Premier League more)\\nx 2 could be ‘is it a knockout game (I tend to care less about the league level matches)\\nx 3 could be ‘is Not Home’ (Can’t watch it when I’m in College. Can I?)\\nx 4 could be ‘is my favorite team playing’ and so on.\\nThese inputs can either be excitatory or inhibitory. Inhibitory inputs are those that have maximum effect\\non the decision making irrespective of other inputs i.e., if x 3 is 1 (not home) then my output will always be\\n0 i.e., the neuron will never fire, so x 3 is an inhibitory input. Excitatory inputs are NOT the ones that will\\nmake the neuron fire on their own but they might fire it when combined together. Formally, this is what is\\ngoing on:\\n'),\n",

It helps a Neural Network to learn from the existing\\nconditions and improve its performance. Thus learning rules updates the weights and bias levels of a\\nnetwork when a network simulates in a specific data environment. Applying learning rule is an iterative\\nprocess. It helps a neural network to learn from the existing conditions and improve its performance.\\nThe different learning rules in the Neural network are:\\n1. Hebbian learning rule – It identifies, how to modify the weights of nodes of a network.\\n2. Perceptron learning rule – Network starts its learning by assigning a random value to each weight.\\n3. Delta learning rule – Modification in sympatric weight of a node is equal to the multiplication of error\\nand the input.\\n4. Correlation learning rule – The correlation rule is the supervised learning.\\n5. Outstar learning rule – We can use it when it assumes that nodes or neurons in a network arranged in a\\nlayer.\\n1. Hebbian Learning Rule: The Hebbian rule was the first learning rule. In 1949 Donald Hebb developed it as\\nlearning algorithm of the unsupervised neural network. We can use it to identify how to improve the\\nweights of nodes of a network. The Hebb learning rule assumes that – If two neighbor neurons activated\\nand deactivated at the same time, then the weight connecting these neurons should increase. At the start,\\nvalues of all weights are set to zero. This learning rule can be used for both soft- and hard-activation\\nfunctions. Since desired responses of neurons are not used in the learning procedure, this is the\\nunsupervised learning rule. The absolute values of the weights are usually proportional to the learning\\ntime, which is undesired.\\nMathematical Formula of Hebb Learning Rule.\\n'),\n",

Perceptron Learning Rule: Each connection in a neural network has an associated weight, which\\nchanges in the course of learning. According to it, an example of supervised learning, the network starts\\nits learning by assigning a random value to each weight. Calculate the output value on the basis of a set\\nof records for which we can know the expected output value. This is the learning sample that indicates\\nthe entire definition. As a result, it is called a learning sample. The network then compares the\\ncalculated output value with the expected value. Next calculates an error function ∈, which can be the\\nsum of squares of the errors occurring for each individual in the learning sample which can be\\ncomputed as:\\nMathematical Formula of Perceptron Learning Rule\\nPerform the first summation on the individuals of the learning set, and perform the second summation on\\nthe output units. E and O are the expected and obtained values of the jth unit for the ith individual. The\\nij ij\\nnetwork then adjusts the weights of the different units, checking each time to see if the error function has\\nincreased or decreased. As in a conventional regression, this is a matter of solving a problem of least\\nsquares. Since assigning the weights of nodes according to users, it is an example of supervised learning.\\n3. Delta Learning Rule: Developed by Widrow and Hoff, the delta rule, is one of the most common\\nlearning rules. It depends on supervised learning. This rule states that the modification in sympatric\\nweight of a node is equal to the multiplication of error and the input. In Mathematical form the delta\\nrule is as follows:\\nMathematical Formula of Delta Learning Rule\\nFor a given input vector, compare the output vector is the correct answer. If the difference is zero, no\\nlearning takes place; otherwise, adjusts its weights to reduce this difference. The change in weight from ui\\nto uj is: dwij = r* ai * ej. where r is the learning rate, ai represents the activation of ui and ej is the difference\\nbetween the expected output and the actual output of uj. If the set of input patterns form an independent\\nset then learn arbitrary associations using the delta rule.\\nIt has seen that for networks with linear activation functions and with no hidden units.\\nThe error squared vs. the weight graph is a paraboloid in n-space. Since the proportionality constant is\\nnegative, the graph of such a function is concave upward and has the least value. The vertex of this\\nparaboloid represents the point where it reduces the error. The weight vector corresponding to this point\\nis then the ideal weight vector. We can use the delta learning rule with both single output unit and several\\noutput units. While applying the delta rule assume that the error can be directly measured. The aim of\\napplying the delta rule is to reduce the difference between the actual and expected output that is the error.\\n4. Correlation Learning Rule: The correlation learning rule based on a similar principle as the\\nHebbian learning rule. It assumes that weights between responding neurons should be more positive, and\\nweights between neurons with opposite reaction should be more negative. Contrary to the Hebbian rule,\\nthe correlation rule is the supervised learning, instead of an actual. The response, oj, the desired response,\\ndj, uses for the weight-change calculation. In Mathematical form the correlation learning rule is as follows:\\nMathematical Formula of Correlation Learning Rule\\nWhere d is the desired value of output signal. This training algorithm usually starts with the initialization of\\nj\\nweights to zero. Since assigning the desired weight by users, the correlation learning rule is an example of\\nsupervised learning.\\n'),\n",

Error function—the error function is computed by checking how far away the prediction is\\nfrom the known true value.\\n3. Backpropagation with gradient descent—the backpropagation algorithm calculates how\\nmuch the output values are affected by each of the weights in the model. To do this, it\\ncalculates partial derivatives, going back from the error function to a specific neuron and its\\nweight. This provides complete traceability from total errors, back to a specific weight which\\ncontributed to that error. The result of backpropagation is a set of weights that minimize the\\nerror function.\\n4. Weight update—weights can be updated after every sample in the training set, but this is\\nusually not practical. Typically, a batch of samples is run in one big forward pass, and then\\nbackpropagation performed on the aggregate result. The batch size and number of batches\\nused in training, called iterations, are important hyperparameters that are tuned to get the\\nbest results.

This unsupervised refers to the ability to learn and organize\\ninformation without providing an error signal to evaluate the potential solution. The lack of\\ndirection for the learning algorithm in unsupervised learning can sometime be advantageous, since\\nit lets the algorithm to look back for patterns that have not been previously considered. The main\\ncharacteristics of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are:\\n1. It transforms an incoming signal pattern of arbitrary dimension into one or 2 dimensional map\\nand perform this transformation adaptively\\n2. The network represents feed forward structure with a single computational layer consisting of\\nneurons arranged in rows and columns.\\n3. At each stage of representation, each input signal is kept in its proper context and,\\n4. Neurons dealing with closely related pieces of information are close together and they\\ncommunicate through synaptic connections.\\nThe computational layer is also called as competitive layer since the neurons in the layer compete\\nwith each other to become active. Hence, this learning algorithm is called competitive algorithm.\\nUnsupervised algorithm in SOM works in three phases:\\nCompetition phase: for each input pattern x, presented to the network, inner product with synaptic\\nweight w is calculated and the neurons in the competitive layer finds a discriminant function that\\ninduce competition among the neurons and the synaptic weight vector that is close to the input\\nvector in the Euclidean distance is announced as winner in the competition. That neuron is called\\nbest matching neuron,\\ni.e. x = arg min ║x - w║.\\nCooperative phase: the winning neuron determines the center of a topological neighborhood h of\\ncooperating neurons. This is performed by the lateral interaction d among the cooperative\\nneurons. This topological neighborhood reduces its size over a time period.\\nAdaptive phase: enables the winning neuron and its neighborhood neurons to increase their\\nindividual values of the discriminant function in relation to the input pattern through suitable\\nsynaptic weight adjustments, Δw = ηh(x)(x – w). Upon repeated presentation of the training\\npatterns, the synaptic weight vectors tend to follow the distribution of the input patterns due to the\\nneighborhood updating and thus ANN learns without supervisor.\\nBRIEFLY EXPLAIN MULTI LAYER PERCEPTRON MODEL.\\nIn the Multilayer perceptron, there can more than one linear layer (combinations of neurons). If we\\ntake the simple example the three-layer network, first layer will be the input layer and last will be\\noutput layer and middle layer will be called hidden layer. We feed our input data into the input\\nlayer and take the output from the output layer. We can increase the number of the hidden layer as\\nmuch as we want, to make the model more complex according to our task.\\n'),\n",

Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic\\nin which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1 both inclusive. It is\\nemployed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely\\ntrue and completely false. Fuzzy logic is based on the observation that people make decisions based on\\nimprecise and non-numerical information.\\nOne advantage of fuzzy logic in order to formalize human reasoning is that the rules are set in natural\\nlanguage. For example, here are some rules of conduct that a driver follows, assuming that he does not\\nwant to lose his driver’s licence:\\nIf the light is red... if my speed is high... and if the light is close... then I brake hard.\\nIf the light is red... if my speed is low... and if the light is far... then I maintain my speed.\\nIf the light is orange... if my speed is average... and if the light is far... then I brake gently.\\nIf the light is green... if my speed is low... and if the light is close... then I accelerate.\\nBRIEFLY EXPLAIN CLASSICAL / CRISP SETS\\nA classical set is a collection of objects in a given range with a sharp boundary. An object can either belong\\nto the set or not belong to the set. For example, 5, 10, 7, 6, 9 is a set of integers. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\nis the set of integers between 0 and 10. ’s’, ’d’, ’z’, ’a’ is a set of characters. ”Site”, ”of”, ”zero” is a set of\\nwords. We can also create sets of functions, assumptions, definitions, sets of individuals (that is to say, a\\npopulation), etc. and even sets of sets. Sets are often represented in graphic form, typically by circles, as\\nfigure below illustrates.\\nGraphical representation of the set {1, 5, 6, 7, 10}\\nThe concept of belonging is important in set theory: it refers to the fact that an element is part of a set or\\nnot. For example, the integer 7 belongs to the set 6, 7, 9. In contrast, the integer 5 does not belong to the\\nset 6, 7, 9. Membership is symbolized by the character in the non-membership and by the same symbol,\\nbut barred possible. Thus, we have 7 ∈ {6, 7, 9} and 5 ∈/ {6, 7, 9}.

The notion convention used for fuzzy sets when the\\nuniverse of discourse U (set of input values for the fuzzy set X) is discrete and finite, for fuzzy set X is given\\nby:\\nThe fuzzy set theory was initially proposed by a computer scientist Lotfi A. Zadeh in the year of 1965. After\\nthat lot of theoretical development has been done in a similar field. Previously the theory of crisp sets\\nbased in dual logic is used in the computing and formal reasoning which involves the solutions in either of\\ntwo form such as “yes or no” and “true or false”.\\nFuzzy logic: Unlike crisp logic, in fuzzy logic, approximate human reasoning capabilities are added in order\\nto apply it to the knowledge-based systems. But, what was the need to develop such a theory? The fuzzy\\nlogic theory provides a mathematical method to apprehend the uncertainties related to the human\\ncognitive process, for example, thinking and reasoning and it can also handle the issue of uncertainty and\\nlexical imprecision.\\nExample: Let’s take an example to understand fuzzy logic. Suppose we need to find whether the colour of\\nthe object is blue or not. But the object can have any of the shade of blue depending on the intensity of the\\nprimary colour. So, the answer would vary accordingly, such as royal blue, navy blue, sky blue, turquoise\\nblue, azure blue, and so on. We are assigning the darkest shade of blue a value 1 and 0 to the white colour\\nat the lowest end of the spectrum of values. Then the other shades will range in 0 to 1 according to\\nintensities. Therefore, this kind of situation where any of the values can be accepted in a range of 0 to 1 is\\ntermed as fuzzy.\\nEXPLAIN THE PROPERTIES OF FUZZY SETS\\nFuzzy set have a number of properties. Here are definitions of the most important properties, but they are\\nnot necessary for understanding of the course. If you want, you can go now directly to the next section. Let\\nX be a set and A, a fuzzy subset of X and µA the membership function characterizing it. µA(x) is called the\\nmembership degree of x in A.\\nDefinition 1: Let X be a set. A fuzzy subset A of X is characterized by a membership function.\\nfa : X → [0, 1]. (In theory, it is possible that the output is greater than 1, but in practice\\nit is almost never used.)\\nNote: This membership function is equivalent to the identity function of a classical set.\\nDefinition 2: The height of A, denoted h(A), corresponds to the upper bound of the codomain of its\\nmembership function: h(A) = sup{µA(x) | x ∈ X}.\\nDefinition 3: A is said to be normalized if and only if h(A) = 1. In practice, it is extremely rare to work on\\nnon-normalized fuzzy sets.\\n'),\n",

Fuzzification – convert classical data or crisp data into fuzzy data or\\nMembership Functions (MFs)\\n2.

Defuzzification – use different methods to calculate each associated output and put them\\ninto a table: the lookup table.

In order to\\nenable machines to handle vague language input such as 'Somehow Satisfied', the crisp input and output\\nmust be converted to linguistic variables with fuzzy components. For instance, to control an air\\nconditioner system, the input temperature and the output control variables must be converted to the\\nassociated linguistic variables such as 'HIGH', 'MEDIUM', 'LOW' and 'FAST', 'MEDIUM' or 'SLOW'. The\\nformer is corresponding to the input temperature and the latter is associated with the rotation speed of\\nthe operating motor. Besides those conversions, both the input and the output must also be converted\\nfrom crisp data to fuzzy data. All of these jobs are performed by the first step –fuzzification.\\nIn the second step, to begin the fuzzy inference process, one need combine the Membership Functions\\nwith the control rules to derive the control output, and arrange those outputs into a table called the\\nlookup table. The control rule is the core of the fuzzy inference process, and those rules are directly\\nrelated to a human being’s intuition and feeling. For example, still in the air conditioner control system, if\\nthe temperature is too high, the heater should be turned off, or the heat driving motor should be slowed\\ndown, which is a human being’s intuition or common sense. Different methods such as Center of Gravity\\n(COG) or Mean of Maximum (MOM) are utilized to calculate the associated control output, and each\\ncontrol output should be arranged into a table called lookup table.\\nDuring an actual application, a control output should be selected from the lookup table developed from\\nthe last step based on the current input. Furthermore, that control output should be converted from the\\nlinguistic variable back to the crisp variable and output to the control operator. This process is called\\ndefuzzification or step 3.\\nIn most cases the input variables are more than one dimension for real applications, and one needs to\\nperform fuzzification or develop a Membership Function for each dimensional variable separately.\\nPerform the same operation if the system has multiple output variables.\\nSummarily, a fuzzy process is a process of crisp-fuzzy-crisp for a real system. The original input and the\\nterminal output must be crisp variables, but the intermediate process is a fuzzy inference process. The\\nreason why one needs to change a crisp to a fuzzy variable is that, from the point of view of fuzzy control\\nor a human being’s intuition, no absolutely crisp variable is existed in our real world.\\nAny physical variable may contain some other components. For instance, if someone says: the\\ntemperature here is high. This high temperature contains some middle and even low temperature\\ncomponents. From this point of view, fuzzy control uses universal or global components, not just a limited\\nrange of components as the classical variables did.\\nWith the rapid development of fuzzy technologies, different fuzzy control strategies have been\\ndeveloped based on different classical control methods, such as PID-fuzzy control, sliding-mode fuzzy\\ncontrol, neural fuzzy control, adaptor fuzzy control and phase-plan mapping fuzzy control. More and more\\nnew fuzzy control strategies or combined crisp and fuzzy control techniques are being developed and will\\nbe applied to many areas in our society in the future.\\n\"),\n",

One is fuzzy mapping\\nrules and the other is called fuzzy implication rules.\\nFuzzy Mapping Rules:\\nFuzzy mapping rules provide a functional mapping between the input and the output using linguistic\\nvariables. The foundation of a fuzzy mapping rule is a fuzzy graph, which describes the relationship\\nbetween the fuzzy input and the fuzzy output. Sometimes, in real applications, it is very hard to derive a\\ncertain relationship between the input and the output, or the relationship between those inputs and\\noutputs are very complicated even when that relationship is developed. Fuzzy mapping rules are a good\\nsolution for those situations.\\nFuzzy mapping rules work in a similar way to human intuition or insight, and each fuzzy mapping rule\\nonly approximates a limited number of elements of the function, so the entire function should be\\napproximated by a set of fuzzy mapping rules. Still using our air conditioner system as an example, a fuzzy\\nmapping rule can be derived as\\nIF the temperature is LOW, THEN the heater motor should be rotated FAST. For other input\\ntemperatures, different rules should be developed.\\nFor most actual applications, the input variables are commonly more than one\\ndimension. For example, in our air conditioner system, the inputs include both current temperature and\\nthe change rate of the temperature.

In this air conditioner example, a total of nine rules are developed.\\nFor those applications that need high control accuracy, the input and output should be divided into\\nmore small segments, and more fuzzy rules should be applied.\\nFuzzy Implication Rules\\nA fuzzy implication rule describes a generalized logic implication relationship between inputs and\\noutputs. The foundation of a fuzzy implication rule is the narrow sense of fuzzy logic. Fuzzy implication\\nrules are related to classical two-valued logic and multiple valued logic.

To make that\\nconclusion or fuzzy output available to real applications, a defuzzification process is needed. The\\ndefuzzification process is meant to convert the fuzzy output back to the crisp or classical output to the\\ncontrol objective. Remember, the fuzzy conclusion or output is still a linguistic variable, and this linguistic\\nvariable needs to be converted to the crisp variable via the defuzzification process. Three defuzzification\\ntechniques are commonly used, which are: Mean of Maximum method, Center of Gravity method and the\\nHeight method.\\nMean of Maximum (MOM) Method\\nThe Mean of Maximum (MOM) defuzzification method computes the average of those fuzzy conclusions or\\noutputs that have the highest degrees.

This means that all input and output\\nmembership functions are developed based on the actual experience or the input and output parameter\\nranges of a specified application, and the lookup table is calculated in terms of those definitions of input\\nand output membership functions. The advantage of this method is that most fuzzy inference related\\ncalculations are performed prior to the real implementation and therefore the fuzzy process is less time\\nconsuming.

One component defines the magnetic flux of the motor, the\\nsupplementary is the torque. The control system of the drive calculates from the flux and torque references\\nspecified by the drive's speed control the corresponding current component references. Typically\\nproportional-integral (PI) controllers are employed to keep the measured current components at their\\nreference values. The pulse-width modulation of the variable-frequency drive describes the transistor\\nswitching according to the stator voltage references that are the output of the PI current controllers. FOC is\\nused to manage the AC synchronous and induction motors. It was originally developed for high performance\\nmotor applications that are required to operate smoothly over the bursting speed range, generate full\\ntorque at zero speed, and have high dynamic performance including fast acceleration and deceleration.\\nHowever, it is becoming increasingly attractive for lower performance applications also due to FOC's motor\\nsize, cost and power consumption reduction dominance. It is expected that with increasing computational\\npower of the microprocessors it will ultimately nearly universally relocate single-variable scalar volts-per-\\nHertz (V/f) control.\\nFUZZY LOGIC CONTROLLER\\nFuzzy logic provides a sturdy framework for achieving robust and simple solutions amid different\\napproaches of intelligent computation. Fuzzy model is a collection of IF - THEN rules with indistinguishable\\npredicates that use a fuzzy reasoning such as Sugeno and Mamdani models. Sugeno type systems can be\\nused to model any inference system in which the output membership functions are either linear or constant\\nwhereas Mamdani type produces either linear or nonlinear output. The fuzzy logic controller consists of four\\nstages, fuzzification of inputs and derivation of rules, inference mechanism and de-fuzzification. Fuzzy logic\\nsystems are collective function approximations. In general, the goal of fuzzy logic system is to yield a set of\\noutputs for given inputs in a non-linear system, lacking using any mathematical model but by using\\nlinguistic rules. A general block diagram of Fuzzy logic is shown Fig 1.\\nSYSTEM MODEL\\nThe block model of the induction motor system with the controller be developed using the power system,\\npower electronics, control system, signal processing toolboxes & from the fundamental functions available\\nin the Simulink library in Matlab / Simulink. In this paper, plots of voltage, torque, speed, load & flux, etc are\\nplotted as functions of time with the controller and the waveforms are observed on the equivalent scopes\\nafter running the simulations. The entire system modelled in Simulink is a closed loop feedback control\\nsystem consisting of the plants, controllers, samplers, comparators, feedback systems, the mux, de-mux,\\nsummers, adders, gain blocks, multipliers, clocks, subsystems, integrators, state-space models, subsystems,\\n\"),\n",
